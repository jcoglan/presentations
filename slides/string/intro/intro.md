> Compared to barbed wire fences, concrete walls and radical right-wing
> extremism, the exhibited letters in which the recipient’s name has been
> misspelled may seem to be of little importance. Many computers in Swedish
> companies and government organisations cannot handle the cedilla in Meriç, so
> the letter is either left out or replaced with, say, % or &#231. On closer
> consideration, however, the work _Ç (The Unfortunate Letter)_ is a striking
> example of just how structural and institutional the matter of identity and
> belonging is. The bureaucratic systems do not acknowledge all individuals’
> identities; they deny them the right to be without adjusting to an ancient
> construction (the Swedish alphabet). Symptomatically, the letter ç is excluded
> even in letters from the Migration Board.

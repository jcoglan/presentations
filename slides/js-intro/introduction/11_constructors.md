# Constructors

* Constructors are just functions
* Each constructor has a `prototype` object
* New objects inherit from this prototype
* By convention they have uppercase names
* They must be called with `new`

```javascript
var Person = function(name) {
  this.name = name;
};

Person.prototype.sayHello = function(greeting) {
  return greeting + ", " + this.name;
};

var jcoglan = new Person("jcoglan");

jcoglan.sayHello("Howdy")
// -> "Howdy, jcoglan"

```javascript
// the expression `var user = new Person("jcoglan")`
// is exactly equivalent to:

var user = {};
user.__proto__ = Person.prototype;
Person.call(user, "jcoglan");

// user has its own instance variables,
// but inherits its methods

user.hasOwnProperty("name")     // -> true
user.hasOwnProperty("sayHello") // -> false
```
